![Shane](/images/shane.jpg)

I am an engineer from upstate NY with interests in open-source software, robotics, decentralized systems, language learning, and all sorts of other things. This website will host content about my current projects and maybe some blog posts if I get more comfy (or feel a need to) with writing.

In my day job I write embedded systems software for lighting control systems at Lutron Electronics. I fill my free time with bouldering, reading Spanish novels, and hacking together random prototypes. You can find more or less all my open source work on my GitHub page linked below.

I've been fortunate enough to work on some pretty cool projects already in my life including an electric motorcycle, strawberry-picking robots, locomotives, and smart home hubs. I'm always looking for new cool projects to add to that list!
